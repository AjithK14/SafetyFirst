Emergency Medical Services redistricting web app. Recommends new center locations based on past 911 calls. To use, simply download the repository, run app.py (flask and python3 are required), and open the address given by flask. For number of centers, 3000 is generally a good number. For the file submission, the dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/dejavu23/911-calls-seaborn-plotly-time-series/data should be uploaded to the app. Other datasets can be uploaded, but each row must be a 911 call with a latitude coordinate given in a 'lat' column, a longitude coordinate given in a 'lng' column, and addresses for each call given in the 'addr' column.
